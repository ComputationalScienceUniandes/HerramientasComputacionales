It might be interesting to analize the punctuation marks relative abundance in some given text. Inspired by: https://github.com/adamjcalhoun/punctuation/ and https://neuroecology.wordpress.com/2016/02/15/punctuation-in-novels-2/

Another option, for this or another HW, would be to visualize a sequence. For example, see Recaman sequence http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RecamansSequence.html
